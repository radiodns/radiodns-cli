# radiodns-cli

This package aims to provide a unified command line interface for using
applications of RadioDNS Hybrid Radio.

It's currently considered an "alpha" release and only has basic support for
parsing SPI SI files. In future the project aims to provide more useful
functionality for all areas of RadioDNS functionality.
